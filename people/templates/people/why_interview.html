		<h3>Why Interview?</h3>
		<p class="lead">
			Because your words are gold.
			<br>
			<br>
			Let me explain. This is 21st century, and a lot of people are still stuck on education/jobs which were designed as per 20th century life style and requirements.
			<br>
			<br>
			Believe it or not, Automation and AI are coming. when they are mainstream, most of the people will lose their jobs because a Program or Robot could do their job better than them. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Before that happens, I want people to know that there are new, better, and more effective ways to make money.
			<br>
			So if you are making money using the new careers fields, I want your story on Revensours.
